# Sliding Window Algorithm with Detailed Example Walkthrough

The **Sliding Window Algorithm** is a clever technique used to solve various array-related problems, particularly those
involving subarrays. It optimizes computation by maintaining a "window" of fixed size over the array and sliding it as
needed. To better understand this algorithm, let's go through a detailed step-by-step example using the
array `[2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]` and a subarray size of `3`.

## Example Array and Parameters

Given array: `[2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]`
Subarray size: `3`

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize the variables:
        - `maxSum`: Maximum sum encountered in any subarray of size `3`.
        - `currentWindowSum`: Sum of elements within the current window.
        - `windowStart`: Starting index of the current window.

2. **First Window** (`[2, 1, 5]`):
    - Add the first three elements `[2, 1, 5]` to the `currentWindowSum`: `2 + 1 + 5 = 8`.
    - Update `maxSum` to the current `currentWindowSum` since it's the first window.

3. **Sliding the Window**:
    - Move the window to the right by removing the leftmost element `2` and adding the next element `1`:
        - New window: `[1, 5, 1]`
        - Update `currentWindowSum`: `8 - 2 + 1 = 7`
    - Update `maxSum` to `7`, which is still the largest sum encountered.

4. **Sliding Again**:
    - Move the window again:
        - New window: `[5, 1, 3]`
        - Update `currentWindowSum`: `7 - 1 + 3 = 9`
    - Update `maxSum` to `9`, which is now the largest sum.

5. **Sliding Further**:
    - Slide the window again:
        - New window: `[1, 3, 2]`
        - Update `currentWindowSum`: `9 - 5 + 2 = 6`
    - No need to update `maxSum` as it's still `9`.

6. **Window Completed**:
    - The window has covered the entire array, and we have computed the maximum sum of `9` for a subarray of size `3`.

7. **Function Return**:
    - Return `maxSum`, which is `9`.

## Conclusion

The Sliding Window Algorithm efficiently solved the problem of finding the maximum sum within a subarray of size `3` in
the given array `[2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]`. By iteratively sliding the window and updating the sums, we were able to optimize
the computation and find the desired maximum sum. This algorithm is particularly useful for similar array-based
challenges, reducing redundant calculations and improving overall efficiency.
