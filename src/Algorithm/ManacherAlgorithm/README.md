📜 **Mastering Manacher's Algorithm: A Step-by-Step Guide with Illustrative Examples** 🧩

**Introduction** 🌟
Manacher's Algorithm is a remarkable advancement in palindromic substring detection, offering a linear-time solution to
a problem that was once computationally intensive. This article takes you through the algorithm's inner workings with a
detailed step-by-step example, shedding light on its genius and practical applications.

**The Palindromic Puzzle Revisited** 🧩
Palindromes, strings that read the same forwards and backwards, have intrigued thinkers for centuries. Detecting
palindromic substrings in a given string is a classic challenge with various applications. Manacher's Algorithm provides
a clever and efficient approach to solving this problem.

**Step-by-Step Breakdown: Detecting Palindromes in "babad"** 🌀

Consider the input string: "babad"

**Step 1: Transformation** 🌀
Transform the input string by inserting special characters "#" between each character and at the beginning and end to
handle both odd and even-length palindromes.

Transformed string: "#b#a#b#a#d#"

**Step 2: Initializing Arrays** 🛠️
Initialize an array to store the lengths of palindromes centered at each character. Also, keep track of the rightmost
palindrome boundary and its center.

Palindromic Lengths Array: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Center: 0
Right Boundary: 0

**Step 3: Traversing and Expanding** 🚀
Start traversing the transformed string, updating the palindrome lengths using previously computed information.
